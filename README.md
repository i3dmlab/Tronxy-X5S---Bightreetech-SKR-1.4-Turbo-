# Tronxy-X5S---Bightreetech-SKR-1.4-Turbo-TMC2209
In this repo you find the configuration.h, configuration_adv.h and platformio.ini files to use to code the Marlin firmware for a Tronxy X5S with a Bigtreetech SKR 1.4 Turbo board and TCM2209 drivers

Basic: Marlin bugfix 2.1.x Release

Hotend fan is connected with 2.4 pin of the mainboard  

I am not the creator of Marlin, I am not the creator of SKR boards, I am not the creator of Tronxy X5S printers. 
This is just a user project for an upgrade of the mainboard of the 3d printer. 

IMPORTANT: This is a work in progress project and you use it at your own risk.

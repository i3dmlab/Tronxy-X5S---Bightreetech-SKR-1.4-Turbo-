# Tronxy-X5S---Bightreetech-SKR-1.4-Turbo-
In this repo you find the configuratio.h, configuration.adv and platformio.ini files to use to code the Marlin firmware for a Tronxy X5S with a Bigtreetech SKR 1.4 Turbo board

Basic: Marlin bugfix 2.1.x Release

I am not the creator of Marlin, I am not the creator of SKR boards, I am not the creator of Tronxy X5S printers. 
This is just a user project for an upgrade of the mainboard of the 3d printer. 
IMPORTANT: This is a work in progress project and you use it at your own risk.
